  Advances in agile software delivery methodologies and tools 
  (commonly referred to as _DevOps_) have not yet materialized in 
  academic scenarios such as university, industry and government 
  laboratories. In this position paper we make the case for _Black 
  Swan_, a platform for the agile implementation, maintenance and

# Introduction

Reproducibility is the cornerstone of the scientific method. Yet, in 
computational and data science domains, a gap exists between current 
practices and the ideal of having every new scientific discovery be 
_easily_ reproducible [@donoho_reproducible_2009]. Advances in 
computer science (CS) and software engineering slowly and painfully 
make their way into these domains---even in CS research itself
[@fursin_collective_2013 ; @collberg_repeatability_2016], paradoxically.

Popper [@jimenez_popper_2017] is an experimentation protocol and CLI 
tool for implementing scientific exploration pipelines following a 
DevOps approach. The goal of Popper is to bring the same methods and 
tools used for the agile delivery of software, known as DevOps 
[@kim_devops_2016], to scientists and industry researchers.

Our experience in the past four years developing and evangelizing the 
use of Popper in multiple scientific domains has allowed us to 
identify opportunities where open-source software (OSS) can be used to 
close the existing gap in current research practices. While the Popper 
protocol is relatively easy to follow (wrap experimentation pipelines 
in the form of a sequence of Bash scripts), for many practitioners it 
still represents a big leap between current practices and where OSS 
development communities are today (automated, portable and versioned 
software testing pipelines). To this end, in this position paper we 
make the case for building _Black Swan_[^name], a platform for 
_practical_ reproducible research. In a nutshell, Black Swan enables 
the agile delivery of software created in universities and other 
research institutions, significantly accelerating technology transfers 
between research and operation.

This paper is organized as follows. @Sec:motivation expands on the 
need for Black Swan, while @Sec:components presents the components of 
the proposed platform and how they address the current gaps. 
@Sec:cases illustrates the utility of the platform by describing use 
cases where Black Swan would be used. We close with how related 
software (@Sec:related) and Challenges (@Sec:challenges).

[^name]: Black swans are typically used to illustrate the concept of 
falsifiability: the statement "all swans are white" is proven false 
whenever one can spot one or more black swans. We envision _Black 
Swan_ (the platform) to be a tool for researchers to _easily_ find 
black swans in their computational or data science theories (i.e. 
identify when their claims are false) and, more importantly, allow 
them to investigate **why**.

# Motivation {#sec:motivation}

Following the Popper convention turns out to be a significant
paradigm shift for many users that is hard to accept in the context
of tight submission for publication deadlines. It begins by defining
a pipeline for a scientific exploration, i.e. a sequence of
high-level steps that are carried out when executing an experiment or
analysis. For example, a data analysis pipeline may consist of four
stages: (1) obtain a dataset; (2) pre-process the data; (3) run
an analysis on the data; and (4) produce plots.

The contents of a folder containing scripts for a pipeline are shown 
in @Lst:pipe (many more examples are available on 
Github[^popperized]). Each stage in a pipeline corresponds to a Bash 
script, and it codifies what a person would manually type in a 
terminal otherwise. A stage in a pipeline is a relatively simple list 
of steps, where each invokes other tools, and passes scripts to them, 
which are themselves stored in the same repository.

```{#lst:pipe caption="Contents of a pipeline."}
paper-repo/pipelines/gassyfs
|- README.md
|- baseliner
|  \  config.yml
|- docker
|  |- Dockerfile
|- geni
|  └── cloudlab_request.py
|- results
|  |- output.csv
|  \  visualize.ipynb
|- run.sh
|- setup.sh
\  validate.sh
```

Thus, the Popper convention can be summarized in three high-level 
guidelines:

 1. At each stage of Pick one or more tools from the DevOps toolkit 
    [^devopstoolkit] for each stage of the scientific experimentation 
    workflow.
 2. Put all associated scripts (experiment and manuscript) in version 
    control, in order to provide a self-contained repository.
 3. Document changes as an experiment evolves, in the form of commits 
    to the corresponding repository storing the contents of the 
    pipeline (the scripts).

There are four key aspects that make Popper pipelines practical. (1) They 
are version-controlled, which allows readers to understand what was 
done over time (and why), mimicking a lab notebook; (2) 
thanks to virtualization technology at the language-, OS- or 
hardware-level, they are portable and can be easily re-executed in 
many environments; (3) they are automated; and (4) they are 
self-contained.

Since a Popper pipeline is, fundamentally, a list of Bash scripts 
(with a specific execution order) stored in a version control 
repository with a pre-defined folder structure, one would think that 
the convention it is straightforward to adopt. Based on our first-hand 
experience following the convention in our laboratory, as well as 
teaching hands-on tutorials for the past year, we have identified two 
broad classes of users. On the one hand, there is the user that goes 
through the learning curve and experiences the benefits of following 
the convention, both at the personal level, and when collaborating 
with others. In words of some of the attendees to the tutorials, "it 
quickly pays off" to go through the learning process. On the other 
hand, the fact that a Popper pipeline is implemented _a priori_ (i.e. 
before an article has written), and that creating reusable pipelines 
implies the use of new tools (such as Docker and Spack), its adoption 
is seen by some potential new users as a big paradigm shift. The main 
criticism from this set of people is that "there is no time" for a 
researcher or student to do things in this "radically new way".

Given the above, we see an opportunity to develop new technology to 
close the gap for those that still resist to take the leap. The main 
objective is to create a platform where it is _ridiculously easy_ to 
both, implement and re-execute experimentation pipelines. Our target 
quantifiable goals are "push-button" repeatability (re-execute an 
existing experiment) and "no more than 10 minutes" to assemble the 
skeletal components of a new scientific exploration pipeline (a few 
clicks on a web-based GUI should suffice).

[^devopstoolkit]: For our purposes, any tool that can be invoked on 
the CLI and can be given a script as input is a so-called "DevOps" 
tool. For more on other aspects of DevOps tools see

# Black Swan {#sec:components}

Once implemented, Black Swan will be a community-driven 
reproducibility platform that allows the agile delivery of scientific 
insights. There are four main functional components of the platform.

**External Service Integrations**

One design principle is not to re-invent the wheel. That is, rather 
than re-implementing functionality found in other services or tools, 
Black Swan will have a pluggable mechanism so that it can integrate 
with these. A diagram of basic integrations is shown in 
@Fig:integrations. Version control services will store a pipeline's 
content; input and output will be version-controlled by connecting to 
dataset management services; CI services will continuously validate 
the integrity of a pipeline; and a database service will be used to 
store the history of executions for each pipeline, and as much 
environmental information as possible.

**Pipeline Catalog and Pipeline Builder**

In order to facilitate the adoption of the DevOps practice, the 
platform will incorporate a GUI component to allow users to visualize 
Popper pipelines and their stages. In particular, a _Pipeline Builder_ 
will allow users to "mix and match" stages from an existing catalog of 
community-maintained pipelines (@Fig:pipecatalog). The reusable 
catalog and the pipeline builder illustrate the importance that 
community will have in the success of Black Swan as an OSS project. 
Unless there is a community-wide effort in place. Develop and 
maintaining a pipeline by a single individual is too overwhelming.

**Automated Validation**

A third key component is the notion of pipeline validations. A 
validation is domain-agnostic way of checking that domain-specific 
results are valid. In other words, these are checks that verify that 
the outcome of the execution of a pipeline is as the original authers 
expected it to be. Black Swan will incorporate facilities to quickly 
visualize the status of a pipeline with respect to domain-specific 
validations. @Fig:dashboard shows a concept of this feature.

the GUI.

**Environment Capture and Automated Analysis**

When the validation stage for a pipeline fails, we have found a black 
swan, i.e. the domain-specific expectations of the re-execution of a 
pipeline have not hold. The next task is to find why. Black Swan will 
incorporate facilities to automatically capture the execution 
environment for a pipeline, in machine readable format so that a 
post-processing step can analyze it and compare it against previous 
successful executions in order to try to determine root causes of 
irreproducibility, or to aid researchers in finding them

# Use cases {#sec:cases}

We describe three use cases for which we envision Black Swan to be 
applicable. We envision many more but we see these as key use cases.

**Technology Transfer**

Organizations with _Research and Development_ units such as tech 
companies and government-funded institutions (DOE labs, NASA, 
universities) spend significant amounts of resources transferring 
technology from R&D to production environments. Deploying an instance 
_Black Swan_ internally, using a public one (or connecting a public 
with a private one), would allow organizations to streamline tech (and 
knowledge) transfers.

**Research Curation**

In the past decade, institutional libraries have invested a 
significant amount of resources to the creation of _Data 
Repositories_. These efforts are aimed at systematically managing the 
output of research. For example, EU's [OpenAIRE](http://openaire.eu/) 
initiative is a catalog of software and data containing more than 80 
million entries (each being a code repository or dataset). Similar 
efforts are underway in the US such as the [Center for Open Science's 
Open Science Framework](https://osf.io). We see _Black Swan_ 
complementing these efforts, since Popper enables the curation of 
research by enabling all these existing repositories to be easily 
executed and validated over time.

**Self-validation of Academic Artifacts**

A growing number of Computer Science conferences and journals 
incorporate an artifact evaluation process in which authors of an 
article submit an artifact description[^ad] (AD) that is tested by a 
committee, in order to verify that experiments presented in a paper 
can be re-executed by others. Instead of manually creating and testing 
an AD, Black Swan can be leveraged to automatically test the validity 
of an experiment, assuming the pipeline(s) corresponding to an article 
have codified expectations on their results.

# Related Software {#sec:related}

**Continuous Integration (CI) Software**

Black Swan will leverage CI services to execute and validate research 
pipelines. OSS communities such as those developing and using Gitlab, 
Github and Jenkins can benefit from this platform.

**Code/Dataset Management Software**

OSS communities developing code and data management repositories such 
as [DOE Code](https://www.osti.gov/doecode/), 
[Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/) and [OSF](http://osf.io/) can leverage 
Black Swan to add executable features to the repositories that they 
curate.

# Challenges {#sec:challenges}

Managing changes to code using version-control systems; managing data 
with dataset management systems; continuously integrating (CI) and 
deploying (CD) software; all have become standard practices in OSS 
communities, not because of a fad but because of the quantifiable 
benefits that following best practices imply. To the contrary, in R&D 
settings, these practices are seen as a burden. The biggest challenge 
we face lies in changing the culture within organizations and teams. 
Finding the right incentives so that these users can make the leap and 
adopt agile practices, so they can enjoy the benefits that come from 
embracing DevOps.
